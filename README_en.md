# LTS-ResVersion
### What is ResVersion?
ResVersion is a ResourcePack, which is used to apply the new ResourcePack of higher version to the "outdated" version of<1.14.
### Why ResVersion?
Mojang updated the New ResourcePack on 1.14, and the Classic ResourcePack is no longer supported.
Until now, there are still many PVP servers with low versions of 1.8 and 1.9. As a way to increase the feel, ResourcePack are essential for everyone.
The New ResourcePack has a higher impact feel and eye protection than the Classic ResourcePack.
So there is ResVersion.
### Is ResVersion difficult to make?
I can make it clear that this is really difficult.
The low version uses a digital ID, while the high version uses an English ID.
And the difference between the ID of the higher version and that of the older version is too large.
For example, id "Minecraft:grass"
In Old version, it is a grass block.
In the New version, he is grass.
There are too many problems caused by ID errors like this. Many IDs that have been renamed will appear as "purple black" squares.
### How to use ResVersion?
First, open the folder Project.
Find the version you are using.
Download release.
### Feedback
For cross version projects, mapping errors cannot be completely handled, so if you encounter mapping problems, please try:
F3+T reloads the ResourcePacke;
F3+A reloads all chunks;
If it is not resolved, please uninstall the ResourcePack. If the display is normal, you can submit Issues to provide the game version and ResourcePack version used.
